            Ooh
            I, I just woke up from a dream
            Where you and I had to say goodbye
            And I don't know what it all means
            But since I survived, I realized

            Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
            Nobody's promised tomorrow
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
            Like it's the last night

            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

            Ooh

            Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
            I don't even wanna do this anymore
            'Cause you already know what you mean to me
            And our love's the only war worth fighting for

            Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
            Nobody's promised tomorrow
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
            Like it's the last night

            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

            Right next to you
            Next to you
            Right next to you
            Oh-oh, oh

            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

            Ooh
            I'd wanna be next to you
